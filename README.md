# Bike_Share_Project

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics to the user audience.
